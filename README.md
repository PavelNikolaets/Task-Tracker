This project was created by me in the process of learning Node.js to improve my skills in using this language.

HOW TO USE
I don’t know who will use this in all seriousness, but okay, that’s your business.
First, you must have Node installed.
Then in the directory in which you will save these files you must install all the libraries that this application uses using the "npm i" command. Launch the application itself using the command "node node.js".
